## Design Philosophy

* Each unit should feel distinct, filling out a specific, unique, role.
* Most units should require very little micromanagement to utilize at a intermediate level, but should reward some level of micro (positive examples: stutter-step on most high-attack-speed ranged units in SC2)
* Active abilities should provide meaningful effects beyond stat boosts/reductions, and the number of unit types with active abilities should be kept to a minimum (i.e. do not give active abilities to almost every unit)
* Time-To-Kill should not be too low, to reward strategic positioning/repositioning of units and constructing appropriate unit compositions over speed of execution.
* While they provide a new tactical dimension, air units will be skipped due to the challenges they bring in map design.
# General Overview

Units will be conceptually divided into three "tiers".
- T1 units should be cheap, easy to produce and versatile units which are also weak but not as efficient at any given role as a dedicated higher-tier unit
- T2 units should be moderately priced units which require more time and resource investment to start producing, and provide more specialization. these units should be valuable even as the game progresses into the late game
- T3 units should have a very specialized role and be costly and time consuming to produce, with a significant set of prerequisites. While the presence of these units should define the late game, they should be created in such a way as they require the support of other T1 and/or T2 units.
