# T1

## SC2:
### Terran

#### Marine
fragile damage-dealer infantry. late-game is replaced by ghosts, due to added survivability and utility
#### Marauder
resilient infantry, usually built in small numbers to support marine and ghost groups with their concussive shells upgrade (attacks slow enemies in a radius)
### Zerg
#### Zergling
fast melee attacking unit, later-on mainly used in small groups to attack undefended side bases while the opponent is chasing the zerg player's main army
#### Roach
resilient short-range unit, built less in the later stages as its relatively low damage makes it difficult to trade well and its short range makes it hard to attack enemies
### Protoss
#### Zealot
melee bruiser (high damage, reasonable survivability, but relatively low initial mobility) - early on it serves mostly as a defending unit, mostly used to guard chokepoints, later on when "charge" is researched, it is more extensively used as a replaceable front-line unit to protect the more fragile back-line units
#### Adept
mobile anti-light unit infantry used early on to scout and harass enemy workers, stops being built as units with AoE attacks (high templar, disruptor, colossus) or better harassment capabilities (oracle, zealots with charge upgrade, phoenix) are unlocked
## WC3
### Human
#### Footman
cost effective melee infantry, good in large numbers eventually replaced by spellbreakers and/or knights
#### Rifleman
solid ranged damage unit, gradually replaced by more specialized damage sources 
### Orc
#### Grunt
basic infantry, used as a front line unit until late-game when replaced by the generally-better tauren
#### Headhunters
high-damage ranged unit, slowly replaced by more specialized damage sources
### Undead
#### Ghoul
dual use as both the faction's lumber harvesting worker and a high damage/low-durability melee unit, can be used later on for hero abilities (dark ritual, death pact) but are kept due to their harvester role
####  Crypt fiend - Ranged attacker used as anti-air, due to their "web" ability which temporarily brings affected units to the ground
			- Night Elf
####  Archer - basic long-ranged attacker, usually not used later on due to their fragility, especially against melee attacks
####  Huntress - front-line units with decent survivability and damage which get replaced as more specialized units are unlocked

- T2 units should be moderately priced units which require more time and resource investment to start producing, and provide more specialization. these units should be valuable even as the game progresses into the late game
	- examples from other games:
		- SC2:
			- Terran
####  Siege tank - long range siege unit which requires setup to activate its main weapon, trading its ability to move for great boosts in range and damage. the unit promotes the positional playstyle that defines the terran faction
####  Medivac - support flying unit capable of healing nearby infantry and transporting troops. Initially used to transport small groups of marines and marauders to the opponent's base to harass workers, later used to heal marines and marauders (to offset the cost of their "stimpack" ability), hellbats, and later on, ghosts
			-  Zerg
####  Hydralisk - fragile ranged damage-dealer. in large numbers can constitute the backbone of a mid-game zerg army due to their long range, decent mobility, and ability to attack air units. later on, they can be morphed into lurkers, a powerful burrowed siege unit, but still prove useful against ground armies with some air support, as the zerg's dedicated anti-air option (corruptor) may not be worthwhile
####  Infestor - support spellcaster. this unit is fragile and unable to attack. instead, it provides utility via its 3 abilities: fungal growth (short duration AoE applying a strong slow and damage-over-time effect), microbial shroud (reduces damage taken from air units to allied ground units in an area) and neural parasite (temporarily take control of a nearby enemy unit. during this effect the infestor is unable to carry out any other actions, and the effect ends early if the infestor dies)
			- Protoss
####  Immortal - Resilient anti-tank walker, this unit boasts high survivability and very good anti-armored damage
####  High templar - Spellcaster unit, providing utility via its feedback (remove all energy from targeted enemy unit, making it unable to use its abilities until it regenerates) and psionic storm (powerful AoE damage-over-time) abilities. 2 high templar can also merge to become an archon, a powerful unit with high durability and a powerful AoE attack which deals extra damage to biological targets
		- WC3
			- Human
####  Priest - support spellcaster, providing a variety of utility spells: heal, dispel (remove magical effects form units in an area and damage summoned units), inner fire (temporary increase in hp and damage of an allied unit)
####  Mortar team - fragile long-range artillery unit, specialized in destroying buildings, but can be upgraded to gain a "flare" ability (temporarily reveal an area anywhere on the map) or improve its efficiency against enemy spellcasters and ranged units. 
			- Orc
####  Shaman - support spellcaster with decent ranged attack. has the purge (single target dispel and slow), storm shield (surround a unit in electricity, dealing damage over time to all nearby units), bloodlust (increase move and attack speed of an allied unit)
####  Kodo rider - large support beast with ranged attack and an aura increasing attack damage of all nearby allied units. also has the devour ability, "eating" an enemy unit, storing it inside the kodo (in a manner similar to the transport mechanic) while slowly damaging it. if the kodo is killed while it contains a devoured unit, the unit is released.
			- Undead
				- Necromancer - support spellcaster with 3 abilities: raise skeletons (convert a nearby corpse into 2 skeletons with timed life), cripple (reduce the move ant attack speed on an enemy unit), unholy frenzy (massively increase attack speed of a unit but deal a small amount of damage over time to it)
				- Meat wagon - ranged siege unit, initially specialized in destroying enemy buildings and spellcasters and capable of transporting and preserving corpses to be used by other units' abilities (ghoul's and abomination's cannibalize, necromancer's raise skeletons, death knight's raise dead, crypt lord's carrion beetle)
			- Night Elf
				- Druid of the claw - resilient melee spellcaster, with the abilities roar (buff damage of nearby units), rejuvenate (powerful hp regeneration on a unit) and bear form (transform into a bear, losing the ability to cast rejuvenate, but improving combat capabilities)
				- Hippogryph - melee flying unit specializing in destroying other air units. can use the "pick up archer" ability to merge with an archer unit to become a fast ranged flying harassment unit.
