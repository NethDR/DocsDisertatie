## General considerations

Units will be conceptually divided into three "tiers".
- T1 units should be cheap, easy to produce and versatile units which are also weak but not as efficient at any given role as a dedicated higher-tier unit
- T2 units should be moderately priced units which require more time and resource investment to start producing, and provide more specialization. these units should be valuable even as the game progresses into the late game
- T3 units should have a very specialized role and be costly and time consuming to produce, with a significant set of prerequisites. While the presence of these units should define the late game, they should be created in such a way as they require the support of other T1 and/or T2 units.

Unit active abilities should be kept relatively low in number, and mostly constrained to specific "caster" units.
Avoid low-cooldown, low-duration buff abilities, as they provide little strategic value compared to just increasing the base stats of the units, but artificially increase the action count needed for optimal play.
