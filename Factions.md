For ease of balance and implementations, the factions will share a common "core" set of units and structures (only differing in aesthetics, not in function and stats). Each faction will have a set of deviations from this "core" which will give it its unique game feel.

A 3-faction system seems common in RTS games (such as Starcraft 2, Stormgate, Command and Conquer 2 & 3, Dune 2, Dawn of War 3) for the balance it gives between variety and ease of balance.
